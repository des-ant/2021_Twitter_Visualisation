            <p class="mb-4">
              Twitter, founded in 2006, is an online social networking and microblogging service that allows users to post text-based status updates and messages, known as tweets, of up to 280 characters in length (Tankovska, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama won the presidency in a landslide victory, defeating John McCain by a margin of nearly 200 electoral votes and 8.5 million popular votes (Lutz, 2009).

            <p class="mb-4">
              A major reason for Obama’s victory was his campaign’s online advocacy, allowing the general public to become engaged and empowered volunteers, donors and advocates through social networks, e-mail advocacy, text messaging and online video (Lutz, 2009).
            </p>
            <p>
              Barack Obama’s usage of social media in his political campaigns including podcasting, Twitter, Myspace, Facebook, and YouTube has drawn comparisons to the adoption of radio, television, MTV, and the Internet in catapulting his presidential campaign to
              success and has been a topic of scholarly inquiry (Lewin, 2008).

              In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama had more supporters on Facebook, more “friends” on Myspace, and more “followers” on Twitter than his opponent John McCain - Obama was the most followed person on Twitter (Brandon, 2008; Shade, 2015). At
              the time, Twitter seemed like an afterthought even though it created the most personal connection among voters (Brandon, 2008).
            </p>
            <p>
              Obama’s campaign was able to utilise all social media channels more effectively than McCain’s. The campaign also prioritised and tracked prospective voters entirely through to the polls (Krempasky, as cited in Luck, Beaton & Moffatt, 2010). From the table
              below, it is evident that Obama had a much larger support base than McCain, allowing him to interact with a wider audience, and for voters to advocate the campaign with personal contributions to online networks and communities (Luck, Beaton
              & Moffatt, 2010).

              Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015 with 2.98 million Twitter followers; his follower count increased rapidly thereafter (Lerman, 2020). Like Obama, Twitter has been credited as an important tool in the victory of Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign (Ingram, 2016).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              While Barack Obama was the first US president to fully harness the power of modern social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, no American president has used social media - specifically, Twitter - like Donald Trump (Vazquez, Hickey, Krishnakumar & Boschma, 2020).
            </p>
            <p>
              Trump has tweeted more with each additional year in office (Vazquez et al., 2020). Since taking office in January 2017, he has tweeted more than 25,000 times - an average of 18 times per day, including retweets (Vazquez et al., 2020). His longest break from Twitter in this period was 1.9 days in June 2017, when former FBI Director James Comey was testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee during the Russia investigation (Vazquez et al., 2020).

            <p>
              In accordance with “public interest”, Trumps Twitter account remained unmoderated for most of his presidency ("About public-interest exceptions on Twitter", n.d.; Robertson, 2020).

            <p class="mb-4">
              From the start of his term until May 2019, Trump had insulted 598 people, places, and things on Twitter; targets of insults included politicians, journalists, news outlets, television hosts and programs, former staffers and associates, government agencies, business leaders, books critical of him, the State of California and State of New York, and entire countries (Lee & Quealy, 2019).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Trumps used nicknames to refer to media figures, politicians, and foreign leaders (Bennett, 2018). We can compare this to Obama’s tweets referring to political opposition George Bush and Mitt Romney.
