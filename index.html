              Twitter, founded in 2006, is an online social networking and microblogging service that allows users to post text-based status updates and messages, known as tweets, of up to 280 characters in length (Tankovska, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama won the presidency in a landslide victory, defeating John McCain by a margin of nearly 200 electoral votes and 8.5 million popular votes (Lutz, 2009).

              A major reason for Obama’s victory was his campaign’s online advocacy, allowing the general public to become engaged and empowered volunteers, donors and advocates through social networks, e-mail advocacy, text messaging and online video (Lutz, 2009).
            </p>
            <p>
              Barack Obama’s usage of social media in his political campaigns including podcasting, Twitter, Myspace, Facebook, and YouTube has drawn comparisons to the adoption of radio, television, MTV, and the Internet in catapulting his presidential campaign to
              success and has been a topic of scholarly inquiry (Lewin, 2008).

              In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama had more supporters on Facebook, more “friends” on Myspace, and more “followers” on Twitter than his opponent John McCain - Obama was the most followed person on Twitter (Brandon, 2008; Shade, 2015). At
              the time, Twitter seemed like an afterthought even though it created the most personal connection among voters (Brandon, 2008).
            </p>
            <p>
              Obama’s campaign was able to utilise all social media channels more effectively than McCain’s. The campaign also prioritised and tracked prospective voters entirely through to the polls (Krempasky, as cited in Luck, Beaton & Moffatt, 2010). From the table
              below, it is evident that Obama had a much larger support base than McCain, allowing him to interact with a wider audience, and for voters to advocate the campaign with personal contributions to online networks and communities (Luck, Beaton
              & Moffatt, 2010).

            North Korea and South Korea started out as poor nations after World War II. Today South Korea’s economy and standard of living rank amongst the highest in the world whereas North Korea remains at the bottom of the world’s development ladder (Ellington
            & Ferrarini, 2017). Due to the secrecy of the North Korean government, its economic data is limited and unreliable (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).
